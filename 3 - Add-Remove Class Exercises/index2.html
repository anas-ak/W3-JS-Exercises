        <h1>CRN++: Molecular Programming Language</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p class="marked">
            Synthetic biology is a rapidly emerging research area, with
expected wide-ranging impact in biology, nanofabrication, and medicine.
A key technical challenge lies in embedding computation in molecular
contexts where electronic micro-controllers cannot be inserted. This
necessitates effective representation of computation using molecular components.
While previous work established the Turing-completeness of
chemical reactions, defining representations that are faithful, efficient,
and practical remains challenging. <br>
This paper introduces CRN++, a new language for programming deterministic (mass-action) chemical kinetics
to perform computation.
<ul class="barked">
    <li>We present its syntax and semantics</li>
    <li>Build a compiler translating CRN++ programs into chemical reactions</li>
    <li>Lay the foundation of a comprehensive framework for molecular programming</li>
</ul>

Our language addresses the key challenge of embedding
familiar imperative constructs into a set of chemical reactions happening
simultaneously and manipulating real-valued concentrations. Although
some deviation from ideal output value cannot be avoided, we develop
methods to minimize the error, and implement error analysis tools. <br><br>

We demonstrate the feasibility of using CRN++ on a suite of well-known algorithms
for discrete and real-valued computation. CRN++ can be easily
extended to support new commands or chemical reaction implementations,
and thus provides a foundation for developing more robust and
practical molecular programs.
